`pip install geopy` 

### Google Places API Key

You need a Google Places API key to use this script. You can obtain an API key by following these steps:

2.  Create a new project or select an existing one.
    
3.  Enable the "Google Places API" for your project.
    
4.  Create an API key in the "Credentials" section of your project.

## Usage

## Configuring Search Parameters

You can customize the search parameters by modifying the following variables in the script:

-   `radius`: The search radius (in meters) from the provided address.
-   `lieu_type`: The type of places to search for (e.g., "restaurant," "bakery," etc.).
-   `keyword`: Keywords used to filter the search results (e.g., "italian," "japanese," "fast_food," etc.).
